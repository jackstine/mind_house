Updated to-do list accordingly I have installed flutter using `fvm`

please use `fvm` when using flutter.  `fvm dart` and the `fvm flutter` commands when running flutter.

so I think we need to plan more,  can we look at the @agents/planning-and-design/agent.md file, Understand the scope of the project, then I want you to come up with some questions that will be challenging when testing the application locally on a macOS system we are looking for a way to test this application, headless and also test the application with automation with end-2-end testing such that we can also get photos of the application when it's runninglocally on the machine. 

Update the `developmentâ€“todo.md` file as needed, and the `components.md` as well. As we might need components  specific for testing purposes.
