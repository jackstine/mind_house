going forward use the context7 /flutter/website (for flutter information), /sqlite/sqlite (for sqllite information) when you need to know about flutter and implements in flutter or material ui, and when you need to know about sqllit.  You only need to retrieve information once, so do this immediately.  And do not perform this task again.

let's read the `plan.md` file, and the `design-docs/local-development-testing.md` files.  Let's update the `agents/programming/agent.md` so that for every item in the todo list that requires development we will perform testing. All unit tests need to be completed for each step in the todo.  Please  add into in test on the to-do list when appropriate it is up to your discretion and feel the project.
