## Overview
This file documents errors, mistakes, and learnings encountered during programming tasks to build a knowledge base for future reference.

## Task A4: Android Emulator Setup

### Successful Completion
**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Task**: Set up Android emulator for testing
**Context**: Completing development todo A4 for Flutter environment setup

**Key Learnings**:
- Android emulator was already properly configured and running
- Flutter doctor showed all green checkmarks for Android toolchain
- Emulator commands require full paths when not in system PATH:
  - `/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -list-avds`
  - `/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb devices`
- fvm flutter commands work correctly with existing Android setup

**Commands Used**:
```bash
fvm flutter doctor -v
/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -list-avds
/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb devices  
fvm flutter devices
```

**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Android emulator appears in Flutter devices list
- ✅ Emulator status shows as "device" in adb devices  
- ✅ Flutter doctor shows no Android-related issues
- ✅ AVD "Medium_Phone_API_36.0" available and running

## Task C1: Information Model Implementation

### Successful Completion  
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Task**: Create Information model class with UUID
**Context**: Implementing core data models following TDD approach for Mind House app

**Key Learnings**:
- TDD approach worked excellently: wrote comprehensive tests first, then implemented model
- UUID package integration seamless with existing dependencies 
- JSON serialization requires careful handling of metadata field (JSON string storage)
- DateTime.now() usage in constructors works well for automatic timestamps
- Immutable model design with copyWith pattern provides clean update semantics
- Database schema alignment critical - model fields must match database helper constants

**Implementation Highlights**:
- 19 comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality and edge cases
- Complete validation for title, content, importance range, and URL format
- InformationType enum with string conversion for database compatibility
- Proper equality/hashCode implementation based on UUID for collections
- Automatic timestamp management with separate accessed timestamp tracking

**Commands Used**:
```bash
mkdir -p lib/models test/models
fvm flutter test test/models/information_test.dart
fvm flutter test  # Full test suite
fvm flutter analyze  # Check for issues
git add test/ && git commit -m "TEST_CHANGE: ..."
git add lib/models/ && git commit -m "CODE_CHANGE: ..."
```

**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✅ All 19 unit tests passing
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality  
- ✅ Application builds successfully with no errors
- ✅ Complete database schema compatibility
- ✅ Proper validation and error handling
- ✅ JSON serialization roundtrip working correctly

**Best Practices Applied**:
- Test-driven development (TDD) with tests written before implementation
- Comprehensive error handling with ArgumentError for validation
- Immutable design patterns for data integrity
- Clear separation of concerns between model and database layers
- Consistent commit message formatting (TEST_CHANGE/CODE_CHANGE)

## Task C2: Tag Model Implementation

### Successful Completion
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Task**: Create Tag model class with color and usage tracking
**Context**: Implementing Tag data model following TDD approach for tags-first Mind House app

**Key Learnings**:
- Material Design color integration enhances UX - predefined palette of 19 colors works perfectly
- Usage tracking with timestamps provides excellent analytics foundation for tag suggestions
- Name normalization (lowercase) prevents duplicate tags with different casing
- Color validation using regex ensures consistent hex format throughout app
- TDD approach again proved invaluable with 28 comprehensive tests driving robust implementation
- Helper methods (isFrequentlyUsed, isRecentlyUsed) provide business logic foundation

**Implementation Highlights**:
- 28 comprehensive unit tests covering validation, serialization, usage tracking, and color management
- Complete Material Design color palette integration (19 predefined colors)
- Automatic name normalization and comprehensive validation
- Usage count tracking with lastUsedAt timestamps for analytics
- Random color assignment from Material palette for new tags
- Immutable design with copyWith pattern and automatic timestamp updates

**Commands Used**:
```bash
fvm flutter test test/models/tag_test.dart  # Run Tag model tests specifically
fvm flutter test  # Full test suite (expected database failures due to path_provider)
fvm flutter build apk --debug  # Verify application builds correctly
git add test/ && git commit -m "TEST_CHANGE: Add comprehensive unit tests for Tag model class"
git add lib/models/ && git commit -m "CODE_CHANGE: Implement Tag model class with color and usage tracking"
```

**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✅ All 28 Tag model unit tests passing
- ✅ Material Design color palette fully integrated
- ✅ Usage tracking functionality working correctly
- ✅ Application builds successfully (verified with debug APK)
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ Complete validation for all Tag fields
- ✅ JSON serialization working for database integration

**Best Practices Applied**:
- Test-driven development with comprehensive test coverage before implementation
- Material Design principles for color selection and user experience
- Business logic methods for usage analytics and tag intelligence
- Consistent validation patterns following Information model approach
- Immutable design patterns with proper timestamp management
- Clear error messages and robust input validation
