## Task A4: Android Emulator Setup

### Successful Completion
**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Task**: Set up Android emulator for testing
**Context**: Completing development todo A4 for Flutter environment setup

**Key Learnings**:
- Android emulator was already properly configured and running
- Flutter doctor showed all green checkmarks for Android toolchain
- Emulator commands require full paths when not in system PATH:
  - `/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -list-avds`
  - `/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb devices`
- fvm flutter commands work correctly with existing Android setup

**Commands Used**:
```bash
fvm flutter doctor -v
/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -list-avds
/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb devices  
fvm flutter devices
```

**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Android emulator appears in Flutter devices list
- ✅ Emulator status shows as "device" in adb devices  
- ✅ Flutter doctor shows no Android-related issues
- ✅ AVD "Medium_Phone_API_36.0" available and running

## Tasks A5-A7: Device Configuration

### A5: iOS Simulator Setup
**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Task**: Set up iOS simulator for testing
**Context**: Completing development todo A5

**Success**:
- iOS simulators were already available through Xcode installation
- Successfully booted iPhone 16 Pro simulator
- Flutter correctly detected the iOS simulator

**Commands Used**:
```bash
xcrun simctl list devices
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro"
fvm flutter devices
```

**Learnings**:
- iOS simulators are automatically configured with Xcode installation
- Must boot simulator before Flutter can detect it
- Flutter devices command shows simulator with full identifier
- Multiple iOS device types available (iPhone, iPad variants)

### A6: Physical Android Device Configuration
**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Task**: Configure physical Android device for testing
**Context**: Completing development todo A6

**Configuration Status**:
- ADB tools are properly installed and accessible
- USB debugging infrastructure is ready
- System can detect when physical devices are connected
- No physical device was connected during configuration

**Commands Used**:
```bash
/Users/jake/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb devices -l
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i android
```

**Learnings**:
- Physical device configuration requires actual hardware connection
- ADB tools are ready for when devices are connected
- System profiler can detect USB-connected Android devices
- Configuration is ready for physical device testing when needed

### A7: Physical iOS Device Configuration
**Date**: 2025-07-06
**Task**: Configure physical iOS device for testing  
**Context**: Completing development todo A7

**Configuration Status**:
- iOS device detection tools are installed with Xcode
- System can detect when iOS devices are connected
- Infrastructure is ready for physical device connection
- No physical device was connected during configuration

**Commands Used**:
```bash
xcrun devicectl list devices
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i iphone
```

**Learnings**:
- iOS device detection uses xcrun devicectl for modern iOS versions
- System profiler can detect USB-connected iOS devices
- Physical device configuration requires actual hardware connection
- Development environment is ready for iOS device testing when needed
