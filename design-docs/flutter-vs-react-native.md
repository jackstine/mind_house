## Decision Factors Summary

### Choose Flutter If:
- Want consistent UI across platforms
- Performance is critical
- Team willing to learn Dart
- Need advanced custom animations
- Want smaller app size

### Choose React Native If:
- Team has JavaScript/React experience
- Need platform-specific native look
- Want access to larger library ecosystem
- Prefer familiar web development patterns
- Need faster initial development

## Recommended Choice for Mind Map App

Based on the tag-focused, offline-first requirements and the need for smooth chip interactions, both frameworks are viable. The decision should be based on:

1. **Team Experience**: JavaScript familiarity favors React Native
2. **Performance Requirements**: Flutter slight edge for smooth animations
3. **Development Speed**: React Native for faster prototyping
4. **Long-term Maintenance**: Flutter for consistency, React Native for ecosystem

## Next Steps
- Evaluate team's existing skills
- Create small prototypes in both frameworks
- Test tag input performance on target devices
- Assess long-term maintenance requirements
