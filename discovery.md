# Discovery Documentation

## Application Overview
**Mind Map** - A cross-platform mobile application that serves as a "second mind" for users, helping them store, organize, and quickly retrieve information. The app focuses on providing an intuitive interface for managing personal knowledge and enhancing memory capabilities.

## Key Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Quick information input and retrieval
- Cross-platform support (iOS and Android)
- Persistent data storage
- Easy-to-use UI/UX for memory enhancement
- Support for approximately 1000 initial users

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Fast response times for information retrieval
- Usability: Intuitive interface for all user types
- Scalability: Able to handle growth beyond initial 1000 users
- Reliability: Persistent storage that users can trust as their "second mind"

## Technology Research
### Frontend - Cross-Platform Mobile Frameworks
**Research Findings (2025-07-05):**

**1. Flutter (Recommended)**
- Most popular framework (46% developer adoption)
- Compiles to native ARM code for superior performance
- Hot Reload for rapid development
- Pixel-perfect UI control
- Growing community backed by Google
- Language: Dart

**2. React Native**
- Strong contender (42% developer adoption)
- Larger community and ecosystem
- JavaScript-based (easier for web developers)
- Near-native performance
- Excellent third-party library support
- Meta (Facebook) backing

**3. Other Options:**
- Ionic: Web-based approach, good for simpler apps
- Xamarin: C#/.NET, good for Microsoft ecosystem
- Kotlin Multiplatform: Native code sharing

### Backend - Golang Frameworks for PostgreSQL
**Research Findings (2025-07-05):**

**Top Golang Web Frameworks:**

1. **Gin (Highly Recommended)**
   - Most popular Go framework
   - 40x faster performance than Martini
   - Excellent for REST APIs
   - Built-in JSON validation
   - Minimal memory footprint
   - Perfect for mobile backends

2. **Beego**
   - Enterprise-grade framework
   - MVC architecture
   - Built-in ORM support
   - Comprehensive tooling
   - Good for large applications

3. **Echo**
   - Minimalist and high performance
   - Optimized routing engine
   - Easy middleware management
   - Great for microservices

4. **Fiber**
   - Express.js-inspired
   - Built on FastHTTP
   - Extremely fast performance
   - Low memory usage

**PostgreSQL Integration:**
- **GORM** - The most popular Go ORM
  - 34,000+ GitHub stars
  - Multi-database support
  - Auto-migration capabilities
  - Type-safe queries
  - Relationship handling

- **Native pq driver** - Direct PostgreSQL access
  - Lightweight option
  - Full control over queries
  - Better for simple use cases

### Database Architecture
**Confirmed: PostgreSQL**
- Excellent for relational data
- Strong consistency and ACID compliance
- JSON support for flexible schemas
- Full-text search capabilities
- Scalable for 1000+ users

**Additional Considerations:**
- Local SQLite for offline caching
- Sync mechanism between local and cloud
- Redis for session/cache management

## User Personas
### Primary User
- **General User**: Anyone seeking to enhance their memory and information organization
- **Needs**: Quick information capture, reliable retrieval, intuitive organization
- **Goals**: Build a reliable "second mind" that augments their natural memory

## Business Logic
*Core features to explore:*
- Information input methods
- Organization structure (mind map visualization vs text-based)
- Search and retrieval mechanisms
- Data relationships and connections

## Integration Requirements
- No external system integrations required initially

## Constraints & Assumptions
### Constraints
- Mobile-only (iOS and Android)
- No specific timeline pressure
- Open technology choice

### Assumptions
- Users want a simple, intuitive interface
- Information should be quickly accessible
- Data persistence is critical

## UI/UX Design Patterns for Mind Mapping
**Research Findings (2025-07-05):**

### Key Design Principles
1. **Minimalist Interface**
   - Clean lines and monochromatic color schemes
   - Reduced cognitive load
   - Users assess designs in 50ms - simplicity wins

2. **Visual Organization**
   - Start with central node (user's main thought)
   - Branch out to related concepts
   - Color coding for categories
   - Visual hierarchy for prioritization

3. **Mobile-Specific Features**
   - Gesture-based navigation
   - Touch-optimized node creation
   - Pinch-to-zoom for overview/detail
   - Dark mode support

4. **AI-Enhanced Features**
   - Auto-suggest related topics
   - Smart categorization
   - Intelligent search
   - Voice input with transcription

5. **Collaboration Capabilities**
   - Real-time syncing
   - Sharing specific branches
   - Multi-user editing
