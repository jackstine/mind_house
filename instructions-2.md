move the `planning-todo.md` file and place it in the `previous-todos` folder.  Since we completed it.  Update the `workflow.md` file, when we complete a `todo` file, place it in the `previous-todo` folder.

let's update the `workflow.md` file so that every design doc created it will be in the folder `design–docs`.

Using the tag  base component, I want to ensure that users can get a suggestion of other tags to add based off the input of tags of the user. Please come up with ideas and how the user experience should feel for this one single component and user interaction place this in the file `tagging-component.md`

can we use SQL light on a android or iOS application?  Please place this information in the `answered.md` file, update the `workflow.md`. When the user request a question that was not prompted to the user in the `Q&A.md` file make sure that the question and the answer are in the `answered.md` file.

Another question  how are we going to run the application locally on a macOS system in both android and iOS do we have to consider the size of the application according to the phone let's get a design dock on that please. Also  how do we test the flutter application? Please provide me with some test libraries. Let me know of some that are BDD W We need the ability to take snapshots of the application and also do into in testing on the application as well take snapshots of each action. This will be a primary goal for taste testing capabilities.

 I think we want to construct the `information` schema definerintly. 

Ability to add a color to the tags is great, let's do that.

let's put user preferences in the backlog to come back to later.

We are going to build the application using flutter. Let me know if we need to do some more research of this in the `Q&A.md`. 

I like  #### Material Design Components **Link**: https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/material

I do not like **flutter_tagging_plus**: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tagging_plus

do not use https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tagging_plus

let's use **bloc**: https://pub.dev/packages/bloc

I do want any of the other packages mentioned. do not use them please.

ok let's us the flutter resources mentioned at  **Flutter Documentation**: https://docs.flutter.dev/ and 

maybe use the quick sort component when searching using the https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_tagging_plus componet. Definite want to limit to the top 10 search results.  but for now let's put this in the backlog.

I like the chips concept, i want to use those. The Material Design looks great. 

Add this to the backlog when we remove a tag the user has to be in editing mode in by one click on the component that contains all the tags then the tags will show an X next to them and re-rendered then the user will be able to remove them.

utilize everything made in the `tagging–design.md` file.


We are going to use SqlLite we will not use NoSQL because we need high read capabilities.
