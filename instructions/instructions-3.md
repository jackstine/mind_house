│ > ok now I want to take our plans that we have created and I want to create to do list to create the application. Add this to the `workflow.md` file. When creating a to do  │
│   list, it needs to be organized based off criteria that groups Like categories together also the to do list should include dependencies of the other categories that that   │
│   category to do list depends on.  I.e. D depends on (B,C) for the development of the application.  This way our to do list will be categorized by priority, dependencies,   │
│   and drinking.  When creating the to do list, ensure that each category lets up list contain steps that are modulized.  I would like each todo To be one finite unit of     │
│   work. Then update the 'plan.md' file accordingly, Please reference the `design–docs` folder for further information on the to do list and the planning of the to do list   │
│   as well. Please think about this. Update the `workflow.md` file with this information                                                                                      │
