**Score: 85/100**

**Input Validation Security:**
```dart
// TagInput Component Security
✅ Input length validation (maxTagLength: 50)
✅ Duplicate detection with case-insensitive options
✅ Custom validation callback support
✅ XSS prevention through text sanitization
⚠️ No SQL injection protection for tag storage
⚠️ Missing input rate limiting for suggestions

// ContentInput Component Security  
✅ Content length restrictions enforced
✅ Markdown parsing safety (display only)
✅ Auto-save data validation
⚠️ No content filtering for malicious patterns
⚠️ Missing CSRF protection for auto-save
```

**Security Best Practices Implemented:**
- Input sanitization for user-generated content

- No rate limiting on suggestion callbacks
- Auto-save functionality lacks encryption at rest
- Missing protection against malicious markdown injection

### 3.2 Data Handling & Privacy ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
**Score: 76/100**

**Privacy Compliance:**
```yaml
Data Handling Assessment:
  ✅ Local data storage (SQLite) - no external transmission
  ✅ No analytics or tracking implementation
  ✅ User data remains on device
  ⚠️ No data encryption at rest implementation
  ⚠️ Missing data backup security protocols
  ⚠️ No user consent mechanisms for data processing
```

**Data Security Concerns:**
- SQLite database not encrypted (sensitive information vulnerability)
- No secure deletion of user data when requested
- Missing data anonymization for debugging/analytics
- Auto-save functionality could expose sensitive content
- No secure backup and restore mechanisms

**Privacy Recommendations:**
- Implement database encryption using SQLCipher
- Add secure data deletion capabilities
- Implement data export functionality with encryption
- Add user consent mechanisms for data processing features
- Create secure backup protocols with user control

### 3.3 Authentication & Authorization Patterns ✅ GOOD
**Score: 88/100**

**Current Security Model:**
- Local-only application (no authentication required)
- Device-level security relies on OS protections
- No user accounts or multi-user scenarios
- Data access controlled by app-level permissions

**Security Architecture:**
```yaml
Access Control:
  ✅ Single-user local application model
  ✅ OS-level app sandboxing protection
  ✅ No network authentication attack surface
  ✅ Simplified security model appropriate for use case
  ⚠️ No future-proofing for collaboration features
```

**Future Security Considerations:**
- If collaboration features added, will need comprehensive auth system
- Cloud sync would require end-to-end encryption
- Multi-device access would need secure key exchange
- Sharing features would need granular permission controls

### 3.4 Input Validation & Sanitization ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION
**Score: 79/100**

**Current Validation Implementation:**
```dart
Validation Strengths:
  ✅ Tag length validation (maxTagLength)
  ✅ Content length restrictions  
  ✅ Duplicate tag prevention
  ✅ Custom validator callback support
  ✅ Basic text input sanitization

Validation Weaknesses:
  ⚠️ No protection against script injection in content
  ⚠️ Missing validation for special characters in tags
  ⚠️ No protection against malformed markdown
  ⚠️ Auto-suggestion callback lacks input validation
  ⚠️ Missing protection against extremely long input bursts
```

**Security Improvement Requirements:**
- Implement comprehensive input sanitization for all text fields
