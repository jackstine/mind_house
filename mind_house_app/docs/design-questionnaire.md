1. For each section, note your selected answers
2. Calculate section priority scores based on your selections
3. Identify top 5 highest-priority design decisions
4. Use high-priority decisions to guide initial design direction
5. Plan medium and low priority items for later iterations

### Design Priority Calculator

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the questionnaire** by selecting your preferred option for each question
2. **Calculate priority scores** using the scoring system
3. **Create design specifications** using the output template
4. **Validate decisions** with stakeholders or target users
5. **Create design system** based on high-priority decisions
6. **Plan implementation phases** based on priority scoring
7. **Design and test** critical user flows first
8. **Iterate and refine** based on user feedback

This questionnaire ensures that all design decisions are intentional, user-centered, and aligned with technical constraints and business goals.
