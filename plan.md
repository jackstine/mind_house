# Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
**Mind Map** is a tags-first, offline mobile application that serves as a "second mind" for users. The app focuses on quick information capture and tag-based organization, with three core pages: Store Information, Information Display, and List Information. The application prioritizes immediate accessibility and offline functionality.

## Application Focus Areas

### Core Design Principles
- **Tags-First Approach**: Tags are the main focus of the entire application
- **Quick Capture**: Primary goal is immediate information storage
- **Offline-First**: Application operates offline in first phase
- **Tag-Based Search**: No full-text search, only tag-based filtering

### Application Pages Structure
1. **Store Information Page** - Primary entry point for capturing data
2. **Information Page** - Display individual information items
3. **List Information Page** - Browse and filter stored information

### Automatic Behaviors
- App opens directly to "Store Information" page
- After 15 minutes in background, returning to app goes to "Store Information" page
- Quick search button always accessible

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
**Offline-First Mobile Application**
- Local SQLite database for primary storage
- Tag-based information organization
- No backend required for Phase 1
- Cross-platform mobile deployment (iOS and Android)

### Technology Stack
**Frontend Framework**: TBD (Flutter vs React Native)
- Local database: SQLite
- State management: Framework-specific solution
- UI components: Tag/chip-focused design system

**Backend (Future Phase)**: 
- Framework: Golang with Gin
- Database: PostgreSQL with GORM
- API: RESTful endpoints for sync

## Detailed Design

### Application Structure
**Three Core Pages**:

1. **Store Information Page**
   - Primary entry point (app opens here)
   - Main text input area for content
   - Dedicated tag input with chip interface
   - Quick save functionality
   - Auto-return after 15 minutes in background

2. **Information Page**
   - Display individual information items
   - Show associated tags as chips
   - Edit capabilities
   - Navigation to related items

3. **List Information Page**
   - Browse all stored information
   - Tag-based filtering (primary search method)
   - Filter chips at top of screen
   - Multiple tag selection for refined filtering

### Core Features (Phase 1)
- **Tag-First Design**: Primary organization method
- **Quick Capture**: Immediate information entry
- **Offline Storage**: Complete offline functionality
- **Tag-Based Search**: Filter by tags only (no full-text search)
- **Input Chips**: Dynamic tag creation and management

### User Experience Flow
1. App launches directly to "Store Information" page
2. User enters information in main text area
3. User adds tags using chip-based input
4. Quick save stores information locally
5. User can browse via "List Information" with tag filters
6. Returning to app after background time goes to "Store Information"

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Offline Application (MVP)
**Duration**: TBD
**Objectives**: 
- Basic information storage and retrieval
- Tag-based organization system
- Three core pages implementation
- Local SQLite storage

**Deliverables**:
- Functional mobile app (iOS and Android)
- Tag input and filtering system
- Local data persistence
- Basic UI/UX implementation

### Phase 2: Enhancement Features
**Duration**: TBD (Future)
**Objectives**: 
- Improved user experience
- Data portability features

**Deliverables**: 
- Templates and structures
- Import/export functionality
- Enhanced UI components

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Duration**: TBD (Future)
**Objectives**: 
- Collaboration capabilities
- Backend integration

**Deliverables**: 
- User accounts and authentication
- Cloud synchronization
- Sharing capabilities

## Database Design
**Local Storage (SQLite)**:
- Information items table (id, content, created_at, updated_at)
- Tags table (id, name, color, frequency)
- Information_tags junction table (information_id, tag_id)
- User preferences table

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Different behavior on iOS vs Android
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing on both platforms
- **Performance with large datasets**: Tag filtering performance
  - **Mitigation**: Proper indexing and pagination
- **Data integrity**: Local storage corruption
  - **Mitigation**: Regular local backups and data validation

### Business Risks
- **User adoption**: Tags-only approach may not suit all users
  - **Mitigation**: User testing and feedback collection
- **Feature scope creep**: Adding complexity beyond core use case
  - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to backlog prioritization

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals
- **User Engagement**: Daily active usage of information storage
- **Tag Adoption**: Average tags per information item
- **Search Efficiency**: Time to find information using tag filters
- **App Performance**: Sub-2 second app launch time

### Key Performance Indicators
- Information items created per user per week
- Tag reuse rate (indicates good categorization)
- Time spent in app per session
- User retention after first week

## Technology Selection Criteria

### Frontend Framework Decision Factors
- Tag/chip component availability and quality
- Offline storage capabilities
- Cross-platform consistency
- Development and maintenance complexity
- Community support and documentation

### Component Requirements
- Dynamic tag input with autocomplete
- Filter chips with multi-selection
- Smooth list performance with large datasets
- Responsive mobile UI components

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Choose between Flutter and React Native
2. Create detailed wireframes for three core pages
3. Design tag input and filtering interfaces
4. Define exact data schema for SQLite
5. Set up development environment

### Design Documentation Needed
- Component library specification
- Data schema documentation
- UI/UX wireframes
- Technical architecture details
