# Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
**Mind Map** is a tags-first, offline mobile application that serves as a "second mind" for users. The app focuses on quick information capture and tag-based organization, with three core pages: Store Information, Information Display, and List Information. The application prioritizes immediate accessibility and offline functionality.

## Application Focus Areas

### Core Design Principles
- **Tags-First Approach**: Tags are the main focus of the entire application
- **Quick Capture**: Primary goal is immediate information storage
- **Offline-First**: Application operates offline in first phase
- **Tag-Based Search**: No full-text search, only tag-based filtering

### Application Pages Structure
1. **Store Information Page** - Primary entry point for capturing data
2. **Information Page** - Display individual information items
3. **List Information Page** - Browse and filter stored information

### Automatic Behaviors
- App opens directly to "Store Information" page
- After 15 minutes in background, returning to app goes to "Store Information" page
- Quick search button always accessible

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
**Offline-First Mobile Application**
- Local SQLite database for primary storage
- Tag-based information organization
- No backend required for Phase 1
- Cross-platform mobile deployment (iOS and Android)

### Technology Stack
**Frontend Framework**: Flutter (Selected)
- Local database: SQLite (sqflite package)
- State management: BLoC pattern
- UI components: Material Design Components (built-in chips)
- Development: Material Design 3 chips, built-in Flutter widgets

**Excluded Libraries**:
- flutter_tagging_plus: Explicitly avoided per requirements
- Other third-party tagging libraries: Using built-in Material Design

**Backend (Future Phase)**: 
- Framework: Golang with Gin (deferred to backlog)
- Database: PostgreSQL with GORM (deferred to backlog)
- API: RESTful endpoints for sync (deferred to backlog)

## Detailed Design

### Application Structure
**Three Core Pages**:

1. **Store Information Page**
   - Primary entry point (app opens here)
   - Main text input area for content
   - Dedicated tag input with chip interface
   - Quick save functionality
   - Auto-return after 15 minutes in background

2. **Information Page**
   - Display individual information items
   - Show associated tags as chips
   - Edit capabilities
   - Navigation to related items

3. **List Information Page**
   - Browse all stored information
   - Tag-based filtering (primary search method)
   - Filter chips at top of screen
   - Multiple tag selection for refined filtering

### Core Features (Phase 1)
- **Tag-First Design**: Primary organization method
- **Quick Capture**: Immediate information entry
- **Offline Storage**: Complete offline functionality
- **Tag-Based Search**: Filter by tags only (no full-text search)
- **Input Chips**: Dynamic tag creation and management

### User Experience Flow
1. App launches directly to "Store Information" page
2. User enters information in main text area
3. User adds tags using chip-based input
4. Quick save stores information locally
5. User can browse via "List Information" with tag filters
6. Returning to app after background time goes to "Store Information"

## Development Guidelines

### Category Dependencies
- **A (Environment Setup)**: No dependencies
- **B (Database Layer)**: Depends on A
- **C (Core Models)**: Depends on A, B  
- **D (State Management)**: Depends on A, C
- **E (Core UI Components)**: Depends on A, D
- **F (Page Components)**: Depends on A, C, D, E
- **G (Navigation)**: Depends on A, F
- **H (Business Logic)**: Depends on A, B, C, D, E, F
- **I (Testing Infrastructure)**: Depends on A
- **J (Testing Implementation)**: Depends on H, I
- **K (Optimization)**: Depends on H, J
- **L (Deployment)**: Depends on H, J, K

### Task Management
- Reference `development-todo.md` for detailed task breakdowns
- Each task should be 1-4 hours of work
- Cannot start a new category until all dependencies are 100% complete
- Tasks within a category can be worked on in parallel
- Regular code reviews after completing each category

## Database Design
**Local Storage (SQLite)**:
- Information items table (id, content, created_at, updated_at, is_deleted)
- Tags table (id, name, display_name, color, usage_count, created_at, last_used_at)
- Information_tags junction table (information_id, tag_id, created_at)
- User preferences: Moved to backlog (using hardcoded defaults)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Different behavior on iOS vs Android
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing on both platforms
- **Performance with large datasets**: Tag filtering performance
  - **Mitigation**: Proper indexing and pagination
- **Data integrity**: Local storage corruption
  - **Mitigation**: Regular local backups and data validation

### Business Risks
- **User adoption**: Tags-only approach may not suit all users
  - **Mitigation**: User testing and feedback collection
- **Feature scope creep**: Adding complexity beyond core use case
  - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to backlog prioritization

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals
- **User Engagement**: Daily active usage of information storage
- **Tag Adoption**: Average tags per information item
- **Search Efficiency**: Time to find information using tag filters
- **App Performance**: Sub-2 second app launch time

### Key Performance Indicators
- Information items created per user per week
- Tag reuse rate (indicates good categorization)
- Time spent in app per session
- User retention after first week

## Technology Selection Criteria

### Frontend Framework Decision Factors
- Tag/chip component availability and quality
- Offline storage capabilities
- Cross-platform consistency
- Development and maintenance complexity
