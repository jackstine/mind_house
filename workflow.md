# Application Development Workflow

## Overview
This workflow is designed to create a new application through a structured discovery and planning process that ensures thorough understanding before implementation.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery
- **Objective**: Gather comprehensive information about the application requirements
- **Activities**:
  - Ask targeted questions to understand user needs
  - Research relevant technologies and approaches
  - Document findings in `discovery.md`
  - Continuously update Q&A with new questions and answers
- **Output**: Complete discovery documentation

### Phase 2: Planning
- **Objective**: Create a solid architectural plan based on discovery findings
- **Activities**:
  - Analyze discovery information
  - Design application architecture
  - Create implementation roadmap
  - Document plan in `plan.md`
  - Iterate on plan based on user feedback
- **Output**: Detailed implementation plan

### Phase 3: Implementation (Future)
- **Objective**: Build the application according to the plan
- **Activities**: TBD based on completed plan

## Key Files

- **workflow.md**: This file - documents the overall workflow
- **formatting.md**: Formatting guidelines for all documentation files
- **Q&A.md**: Questions and answers organized by status
- **discovery.md**: All discovered information and insights
- **plan.md**: Detailed application architecture and implementation plan

## Process Notes

- Questions must be asked to validate discoveries and plans
- User feedback is essential at each phase
- All information should be properly documented in designated files
- Iterate until sufficient information is gathered for solid planning
